# `conf.py` Documentation

The `conf.py` file is a configuration script used within your project, specifically for categorizing various types of requests, links, and validity states. This file employs Python's `Enum` class to define a series of enumerations that are used to standardize and simplify the handling of specific functionalities in your application. Below is a comprehensive documentation of the code including its functionalities and use cases.

## Overview

The `conf.py` file leverages the `Enum` module from Python's standard library for defining symbolic names bound to unique, constant values. This approach aids in maintaining clarity and consistency across the codebase by avoiding "magic numbers" and improving code readability.

## Enumerations

### RequestType

The `RequestType` enumeration classifies different types of requests that can be made in your application, specifically related to user accounts. Here are the defined types:

| Enum Member          | Value | Description                                          |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `NEW_ACCOUNT`        | `1`   | Request generated during user registration workflow. |
| `FORGOT_PASSWORD`    | `2`   | Request generated for password recovery process.     |
| `FORGOT_USERNAME`    | `3`   | Request generated for username recovery process.     |

### LinkType

The `LinkType` enumeration categorizes the status of links used in the application, such as those sent in emails for account actions.

| Enum Member | Value | Description                      |
|-------------|-------|----------------------------------|
| `VALID`     | `1`   | The link is valid.               |
| `INVALID`   | `2`   | The link is invalid.             |
| `EXPIRED`   | `3`   | The link has expired.            |

### ValidityType

The `ValidityType` enumeration determines the validity status of a token, often used in authentication processes.

| Enum Member | Value | Description             |
|-------------|-------|-------------------------|
| `VALID`     | `1`   | Token is valid.         |
| `INVALID`   | `2`   | Token is invalid.       |

## Usage

These enumerations are intended to be used throughout your application wherever these specific statuses or types need to be checked. For example, you might use `RequestType` to determine the flow of a user's request, or `LinkType` to validate a link's accessibility.

Here's an example of how these enumerations might be used:

```python
from conf import RequestType, LinkType, ValidityType

def handle_request(request_type):
    if request_type == RequestType.NEW_ACCOUNT:
        return "Handling new account registration."
    elif request_type == RequestType.FORGOT_PASSWORD:
        return "Handling password recovery."
    elif request_type == RequestType.FORGOT_USERNAME:
        return "Handling username recovery."

# Example usage
print(handle_request(RequestType.NEW_ACCOUNT))
```

## Summary

The `conf.py` file provides a clear and organized way to manage different types of requests, link statuses, and token validity within your application through the use of enumerations. By defining these constants, you can ensure your code remains clean, readable, and free of hard-coded values. This file is an essential part of maintaining a robust and scalable codebase.
