# Documentation for `iframetemplate.html` File

## Overview
The `iframetemplate.html` file is a template file used for rendering dynamic content, specifically within iframes on webpages. It contains HTML and CSS code that styles the content displayed in the iframe based on the section being viewed. The template is structured to provide a seamless user experience with dynamic styling and interactive elements.

## File Structure
- **HTML Content**: The file uses Django template tags and filters for rendering dynamic content.
- **CSS Styling**: Contains inline styles that adjust the appearance of the content based on the section.
- **JavaScript**: Contains a script to handle tab navigation within the iframe.

## HTML Content

### Template Logic
- **`{{source|safe}}`**: This is a Django template variable that is rendered safely, allowing HTML content to be injected into the template without escaping.
- **`{% if section == 'fe' %}`**: This conditional block checks if the current section is 'fe' (frontend) and applies corresponding styles.

## CSS Styling

### `fe` Section
When the section is 'fe', the following styles are applied:
- **Background Colors**: Sets the background of various elements to black for a dark theme.
- **Text Colors**: Sets text color to white for better contrast against the dark background.
- **Visibility and Layout**: Hides certain elements like image wrappers and adjusts the padding of information sections.

### Default Section
For other sections, the following styles are used:
- **Background Colors**: Sets a light theme with white backgrounds.
- **Text Colors**: Uses a darker text color for readability.
- **Tab Management**: Styles the tabs to have a distinctive look with active and hover states.

## JavaScript Functionality

### Tab Activation
A script is included that automatically activates the "matches" tab within the iframe:
- **Event Listener**: Waits for the DOM to be fully loaded before executing.
- **Tab Management**: Removes the 'active' class from all tabs and sets it to the "matches" tab. This ensures that the user sees the matches section by default.

## Usage

### Dynamic Content Injection
- **Source Content**: The `{{source|safe}}` variable can be dynamically set from the server-side, enabling the injection of HTML content into the iframe.

### Section-Specific Styling
- **Conditional Styles**: Depending on the `section` variable, different styles are applied, allowing for flexible design choices based on user roles or preferences.

## Conclusion
The `iframetemplate.html` file is designed to render content dynamically within iframes with responsive and section-specific styling. It leverages Django templating for dynamic content injection and includes JavaScript for interactive tab management, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface.
