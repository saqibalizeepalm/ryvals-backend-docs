# üìÑ Documentation for `initial_data.json`

The `initial_data.json` file in Django is typically used to provide a set of initial data for the database. This can be particularly useful for setting up default users, configurations, or any other necessary data required for the application to run smoothly. This file is usually added to the project to ensure that when the application is deployed or re-deployed, it has the required initial data available.

## üéØ Purpose
The `initial_data.json` file serves to prepopulate the database with essential data, often including admin accounts, roles, and basic configurations. This data is loaded whenever the `loaddata` management command is executed, allowing for consistent setups across different environments.

## üóÑÔ∏è Structure

The file is structured as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a database entry for a specific model.

### Example Structure
```json
[
    {
        "model": "app_name.model_name",
        "pk": primary_key_value,
        "fields": {
            "field_name": field_value,
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
]
```

### Description of the Example File

In this specific `initial_data.json` file, we have two entries for the `accounts.user` model.

| Field Name        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`           | Specifies the Django model for which this entry is created.                 |
| `pk`              | The primary key for the database entry.                                     |
| `fields`          | Contains the actual data fields for the model.                              |
