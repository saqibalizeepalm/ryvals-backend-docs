# Documentation for `messages.py` üìú

The `messages.py` file in a Django project is typically used to store user-facing messages and error notifications that can be utilized throughout the application. This file contains a set of constants that are translated using Django's translation system, making it easier to support multiple languages. Each message is defined with a unique identifier that can be used in the application code to provide feedback to the user.

## Introduction

The `messages.py` file leverages Django's `gettext_lazy` for translation purposes, allowing messages to be marked for translation. This is particularly useful in applications that need to support multiple languages, as it separates the content from the code logic.

## Purpose and Usage üéØ

- **Centralized Management**: All user-facing messages are managed in one place for easy updates and consistency across the application.
- **Localization and Internationalization**: Using `gettext_lazy`, these messages can be translated into different languages, which is crucial for applications aiming for a global audience.
- **Code Readability**: By using descriptive constants, the code becomes more readable and maintainable.

## Message List üìú

Here is a detailed list of messages included in the file with their descriptions:

## Translation üåç

All messages are wrapped in Django's `gettext_lazy` function, which marks them for translation. This allows the application to provide these messages in different languages, depending on the user's locale settings.

```python
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

LINK_EXPIRED = _('Link has expired')
```

By using this approach, developers can easily manage translations in Django applications using standard `.po` and `.mo` files. This makes it easier to maintain and update translations as the application grows or changes.
