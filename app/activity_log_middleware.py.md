# Activity Log Middleware Documentation

## Overview
The `activity_log_middleware.py` file introduces middleware for starting activity logs within a Django application. Middleware in Django is a way to process requests and responses globally. This particular middleware is designed to ensure that a logging thread is started when the server begins handling requests.

## Introduction
Middleware is a layer that processes requests and responses in Django. The `ActivityLogMiddleware` class in this file is responsible for managing the start of a logging thread whenever the server begins handling requests.

## Code Explanation

```python
from app.services.start_logger_when_server_starts import LOGGER_THREAD

class ActivityLogMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        print("STARTING ACTIVITY LOGS THREAD : ", LOGGER_THREAD)
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        response = self.get_response(request)
        return response
```

### Key Components

- **Import Statement**
  - `from app.services.start_logger_when_server_starts import LOGGER_THREAD`: This line imports the `LOGGER_THREAD` from a service module, presumably responsible for handling logging operations.

- **ActivityLogMiddleware Class**
  - **`__init__` Method**: This constructor method is called once when the middleware is initialized. It accepts a `get_response` function as an argument, which is used to process requests.
    - **Logging Start**: The line `print("STARTING ACTIVITY LOGS THREAD : ", LOGGER_THREAD)` outputs a message to indicate that the logging thread (`LOGGER_THREAD`) is being started.
    
  - **`__call__` Method**: This method is called for each request. It takes a `request` object and returns a `response` object.
    - **Request Handling**: `self.get_response(request)` is called to continue processing the request, and the resulting response is returned.

### Key Concepts

- **Middleware Execution**: Middleware processes each request and response. In this case, the middleware starts a logging thread that likely records or monitors activities as requests are processed.

- **Thread Management**: By starting a logging thread at the server's start, the application can continually monitor and log activities without interrupting the flow of request processing.

## Conclusion
The `ActivityLogMiddleware` is a straightforward piece of middleware that integrates logging functionality into a Django application. By starting a logging thread, it ensures that all activities are logged as they occur, providing valuable insights and monitoring capabilities within the application.
