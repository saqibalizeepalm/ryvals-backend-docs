## Overview 📝
The `address_service.py` module provides a simple interface to retrieve user address information from the database. It is designed to interact with the `Address` model, which stores address details associated with users.

## Dependencies 📦
The module imports the following:
- **Address** from `app.models`: This is the Django model that represents the address data in the database.

## Class: AddressService 🏢

### Static Method: `get` 🔍
- **Purpose**: The `get` method is a static method designed to retrieve the address associated with a specific user.
- **Parameters**:
  - `user`: The user object for which the address is to be retrieved.
- **Returns**: 
  - An `Address` object if an address is found for the user, otherwise `None`.

### Example Usage:
Here's a brief illustration of how you might use the `AddressService` class in your Django application:

```python
from app.services.address_service import AddressService
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Assume we have a user instance
user = User.objects.get(username='john_doe')

# Retrieve the user's address
user_address = AddressService.get(user)

if user_address:
    print("User's address:", user_address.street_address)
else:
    print("No address found for the user.")
```

## Summary 💡
The `address_service.py` module offers a straightforward and efficient way to access user address data associated with a Django `User` model. By encapsulating the logic within a static method, it provides a clean and maintainable interface for other parts of the application to interact with user addresses.
