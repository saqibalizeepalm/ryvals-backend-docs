## Structure

The template is structured using standard HTML and employs Django's template language for dynamic content rendering. Below is a breakdown of the different sections within the template:

## Template Tags and Loading

- **{% load i18n %}**: Loads internationalization tags which are helpful for translating and localizing content.
- **{% load static %}**: Loads static files, which is crucial for displaying images and other static resources.

### Dynamic Content

Dynamic content is injected into the template using Django template variables such as `{{ name }}`, `{{ email }}`, and `{{ feedback }}`. These placeholders are replaced with actual user-provided feedback data during the rendering process.

## HTML Design Elements

- **Table Layout**: The layout is organized using HTML tables to ensure consistent formatting across different email clients.
- **Styling**: Inline CSS ensures that the email renders correctly and maintains its styling across various email platforms. The email uses a dark theme with white text for contrast.
- **Images and Logos**: The template includes a company banner and logo, with placeholders for social media icons which link to static files.
- **Responsive Design**: Meta tags ensure the email is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
