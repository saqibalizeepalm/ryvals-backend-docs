## üéØ **Purpose**

The `urls.py` file defines the URL patterns for the email API endpoints in the Django application. It connects each URL path to the corresponding view, allowing the application to handle requests to these endpoints.

## üì• **Imports**

Below are the imports used in this file:

```python
from emails.api.views import AddFeedbackAPIView
from django.urls import path
```

- **`AddFeedbackAPIView`**: The view that handles the feedback submission.
- **`path`**: A function provided by Django to define URL patterns.

## üîó **URL Patterns**

The `urlpatterns` list maps URL paths to their corresponding views:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('feedback/', AddFeedbackAPIView.as_view(), name='add_feedback'),
]
```

- **`app_name = 'api_emails_v1'`**: This variable namespaces the URLs, which helps in organizing and referencing URLs throughout the Django project.

### URL Definitions:

| Path        | View                  | Name          |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| `/feedback/` | `AddFeedbackAPIView` | `add_feedback` |

## üß© **Code Explanation**

### `app_name`

- **`app_name = 'api_emails_v1'`**: This variable is used to namespace the URLs. It helps in distinguishing URLs within different apps or versions, especially in large projects.

### `urlpatterns`

- **`path('feedback/', AddFeedbackAPIView.as_view(), name='add_feedback')`**: This line maps the `/feedback/` URL to the `AddFeedbackAPIView` view. The `as_view()` method is called to create a view that can handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.). The URL pattern is named `add_feedback` for easy reference.

## üìö **Summary**

In this **urls.py** file, the primary role is to define the URL routing for the feedback feature of the email API. With the `AddFeedbackAPIView`, users can submit feedback through the `/feedback/` endpoint. The use of `app_name` ensures that these URLs are properly namespaced, facilitating organization and maintenance as the application grows.

This file acts as the entry point for feedback-related HTTP requests in the application, directing them to the correct view for processing.
