# Documentation for `conf.py`

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `conf.py` file, which is part of a gaming application. The file primarily serves to define configuration settings related to lobby filtering using Python's `enum` module.

---

## Overview

The `conf.py` file contains the definition of an enumeration that categorizes different types of game lobbies within the application. Enumerations (enums) are a way to define a set of named values, which can be used to represent different states or options in a clear and type-safe manner.

---

## Code Breakdown

```python
from enum import Enum
```

- **Import Statement**: 
  - The code begins by importing the `Enum` class from Python's built-in `enum` module. This module provides support for creating enumerations, which are a set of symbolic names bound to unique, constant values.

```python
class LobbyFilterType(Enum):
    CURRENT_LOBBIES = 'current'    # Active and Upcoming lobbies
    PREVIOUS_LOBBIES = 'previous'  # Previously played lobbies
    ENROLLED_LOBBIES = 'enrolled'  # Enrolled Previous, Active and Upcoming lobbies
```

- **Class Definition**: 
  - `LobbyFilterType` is defined as a subclass of `Enum`. This class is used to represent different types of lobbies that can be filtered within the application.
  
- **Enum Members**: 
  - `CURRENT_LOBBIES`: Represents both active and upcoming game lobbies. This is useful for filtering lobbies that are currently available for participation or will be available soon.
  - `PREVIOUS_LOBBIES`: Represents lobbies that have been completed or played in the past. This filter is useful for accessing historical data or completed games.
  - `ENROLLED_LOBBIES`: Represents lobbies that a user has enrolled in, which can include previous, active, and upcoming lobbies. This is useful for users to track their participation status across different games.

## Usage

- **Purpose**: 
  - The `LobbyFilterType` enum provides a standardized way to filter and categorize game lobbies within the application. This helps in organizing the lobbies based on their current state and the user's interaction with them.
  
- **Integration**: 
  - This enum can be integrated with other parts of the application, such as database queries, API endpoints, or user interfaces, to filter and display lobbies based on their type.

## Conclusion

The `conf.py` file plays a crucial role in defining configuration settings related to game lobbies. By using the `LobbyFilterType` enum, the application can efficiently manage and filter lobbies based on their state, providing a better user experience and facilitating easier management of game sessions.
