# Game Factory Module Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `factory.py` file. This file defines a **Game Factory** that is responsible for providing appropriate game-specific methods based on the game type. This is a part of the core architecture that ensures different games' unique functionalities are encapsulated within their respective classes.

## Introduction

In a gaming platform, various games come with unique requirements and functions. To handle these efficiently, we use a design pattern known as the **Factory Pattern**. The `factory.py` file implements this pattern to provide an interface for creating objects of different game classes without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

## Class Overview

### GameFactory

The `GameFactory` class is a static class with a single method `get(game)`. It provides an interface to obtain the appropriate game handler object based on the provided game type.

#### Attributes

- **ApexGame**: Identifier for Apex Legends game methods.
- **PubgGame**: Identifier for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds game methods.
- **CODMGame**: Identifier for Call of Duty: Mobile game methods.
- **FortniteGame**: Identifier for Fortnite game methods.
- **PUBGMGame**: Identifier for PUBG Mobile game methods.
- **ValorantGame**: Identifier for Valorant game methods.
- **CODWarzone**: Identifier for Call of Duty: Warzone game methods.

#### Methods

- **get(game)**: 
  - **Purpose**: Returns the game method class based on the `game` identifier.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `game` (str): The string identifier of the game.
  - **Returns**: An instance of the game method class associated with the provided game identifier.

#### Code Snippet

```python
class GameFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get(game):
        context = {
            'ApexGame': ApexGameMethods(),
            'PubgGame': PubgGameMethods(),
            'CODMGame': CODMGameMethods(),
            'FortniteGame': FortniteGameMethods(),
            'PUBGMGame': PUBGMGameMethods(),
            'ValorantGame': ValorantGameMethods(),
            'CODWarzone': CODWarzoneGameMethods()
        }
        return context[game]
```

## Usage

To use the `GameFactory` to get a game-specific method class:

```python
# Example: Get methods for Apex Legends
apex_methods = GameFactory.get('ApexGame')
```

This will return an instance of `ApexGameMethods` which contains all the necessary methods specific to Apex Legends.

## Supported Games

The current implementation supports the following games:

- ðŸŽ® **Apex Legends**: Handled by `ApexGameMethods`.
- ðŸŽ® **PUBG**: Handled by `PubgGameMethods`.
- ðŸŽ® **Call of Duty: Mobile**: Handled by `CODMGameMethods`.
- ðŸŽ® **Fortnite**: Handled by `FortniteGameMethods`.
- ðŸŽ® **PUBG Mobile**: Handled by `PUBGMGameMethods`.
- ðŸŽ® **Valorant**: Handled by `ValorantGameMethods`.
- ðŸŽ® **Call of Duty: Warzone**: Handled by `CODWarzoneGameMethods`.

## Conclusion

The `factory.py` file is a critical component in the gaming platform's backend, allowing for modular and scalable game-specific implementations. By utilizing the Factory Pattern, it ensures that adding support for new games or modifying existing ones can be done efficiently and with minimal disruption to other components.
