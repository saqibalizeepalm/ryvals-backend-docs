# üìú `messages.py` Documentation

This file serves as a centralized location for storing all the user-facing messages that the application might return, especially in scenarios involving success, error, or validation feedback. It leverages Django's translation utilities to support internationalization, ensuring that messages can be translated into different languages as needed.

## üåê Import Section
```python
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
```
- **gettext_lazy (_)**: This is a Django utility function that marks strings for translation but doesn't immediately translate them. This is particularly useful in Django models and forms where the translation will occur later.
