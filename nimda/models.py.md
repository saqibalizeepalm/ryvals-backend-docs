# Documentation for `models.py` ðŸ“„

## Overview
The `models.py` file is an integral part of the Django framework, where data models are defined. These models interact with the database, providing an abstraction layer to manage data in Python objects rather than complex SQL queries. This file in the application defines different models related to locations, community videos, configurations, permissions, logs, and various game-related actions.
