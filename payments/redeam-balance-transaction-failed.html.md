## Template Variables

The template uses several Django template variables to dynamically insert content:

- `{{ request.scheme }}`: The request's scheme (http or https).
- `{{ request.get_host }}`: The current host.
- `{{ transaction_id }}`: The unique identifier of the failed transaction.
- `{{ username }}`: The username associated with the transaction.
- `{{ amount }}`: The transaction amount.
- `{{ date }}`: The date the transaction was attempted.

## Styling

The email uses inline CSS for styling, ensuring compatibility across various email clients. It predominantly uses a dark theme with white text, ensuring readability.

- **Font**: Arial, with different styles and weights for headers and body text.
- **Color Scheme**: A dark background (#191919) with white text (#fff) for contrast.
- **Layout**: Tables are used for layout, a common practice for email templates to maintain consistent formatting across different email clients.

## Utilities

- **Static Files**: The `{% static %}` tag is used to load images from the static files directory, ensuring they are served correctly in the email.
- **Django Template Language (DTL)**: Utilize DTL for inserting dynamic content and handling static files.

This template plays a crucial role in keeping the administrative team informed about transaction failures, allowing them to take necessary actions to resolve issues efficiently.
