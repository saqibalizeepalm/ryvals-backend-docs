## Usage

The `Shift4Interface` class is designed to be utilized within your application wherever you need to interact with the Shift4 payment gateway. It handles authentication, token creation, and transaction processing, ensuring that all operations are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.

---

## Logging

Logging is implemented using Python's `logging` module. The logger captures informational messages (e.g., URLs being accessed, responses from API) and errors, providing a comprehensive trail of the application's interaction with Shift4.
