## `__init__.py`

The `__init__.py` file is typically used to mark a directory as a Python package. It can be left empty or execute initialization code for the package. In this project, it serves as a marker for the package structure.

---

## `admin.py`

The `admin.py` file in a Django project is used to register models with Django's admin interface. By registering models, they can be managed through the Django admin dashboard. The file typically contains definitions for custom admin classes that specify how models are displayed and managed in the admin interface.

---

## `consumers.py`

This file contains WebSocket consumers for handling real-time communication in Django applications using Django Channels. Consumers are analogous to Django views but for WebSockets, handling events like connecting, receiving messages, and disconnecting.

---

## `apps.py`

In Django, the `apps.py` file is used to configure application-specific settings. It usually defines a subclass of `AppConfig` that contains metadata and configuration options for the Django app.

---

## `messages.py`

This file is used to define and manage translatable message strings within the application. It often makes use of Django's internationalization framework to provide translations for various messages used throughout the application.

---

## `models.py`

The `models.py` file defines the data models for the application using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). These models represent the structure of the database and provide an interface for interacting with the data.

---

## `routing.py`

This file is used to define URL routing for WebSockets in Django Channels. It maps WebSocket URL paths to their corresponding consumers, similar to how URL routing is done for HTTP requests in Django.

---

## `tests.py`

This file contains test cases for the application. It uses Django's testing framework to define unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's code.

---

## `friend_serializers.py`

This file contains serializers for handling friend-related data transformations in the application. Serializers are used to convert complex data types (such as model instances) into native Python data types and vice-versa, facilitating the interaction between the frontend and backend.

---

## `dashboard_serializers.py`

This file includes serializers related to the dashboard functionalities, enabling data transformation and validation for dashboard-related operations and features.

---

## `profile_serializers.py`

This file contains serializers for profile-related data. It is responsible for validating and transforming data related to user profiles, including attributes like game accounts, notifications, and social media links.

---

## `game_serializers.py`

This file includes serializers for handling data related to games, such as enrolling players in lobbies, registering teams, and managing game accounts.

---

## `versus_serializers.py`

This file consists of serializers specific to "versus" functionalities, including managing versus teams, challenges, and related operations.

---

## `urls.py`

This file defines URL patterns for the Django application, mapping URL paths to their corresponding views. It acts as a directory for routing requests to the appropriate view for handling.

---

## `dashboard_views.py`

This file contains view classes for handling requests related to the dashboard. It includes views for listing enrolled lobbies, available lobbies, and other dashboard-related data.

---

## `friend_views.py`

This file defines views for managing friendships, including listing friends, sending friend requests, and handling notifications related to friendships.

---

## `game_views.py`

This file includes views for game-related functionalities, such as filing complaints, enrolling players in lobbies, and managing team registrations.

---

## `profile_views.py`

This file contains views for managing user profiles, including updating profile information, linking social accounts, and handling notifications.

---

## `versus_views.py`

This file defines views for handling versus-related functionalities, including creating versus teams, managing invites, and handling challenges.

---

## `affiliate_codes.py`

This file is a Django management command for assigning referral codes to users who have already signed up but do not have a referral code. It generates and assigns unique affiliate codes to these users.

---

## `assign_perm.py`

This management command assigns new permissions to all super admins in the system. It ensures that super admins have up-to-date permissions necessary for managing the application.

---

## `discord_removal.py`

This file is a management command that clears Discord-related information (such as Discord ID and username) from user profiles in the database.

---

## `celery_status.py`

This management command checks the status of a specified Celery process. If the process is not running, it sends an email notification to administrators.

---

## `team_update.py`

This management command migrates existing teams from an old team module to a new team module, updating player associations and team configurations.

---

## `stripe_service.py`

This file defines a service class for handling Stripe-related operations, such as creating Stripe accounts and managing Stripe transfers for players.

---

## `transaction_service.py`

This file contains a service class for creating and managing transaction details, including creating transaction records and handling transaction attributes like amount, status, and type.

---

## `tournament_service.py`

This file provides services for managing tournament operations, including creating cloud tournaments, adding participants, and updating tournament details. It interacts with external services for managing tournament brackets and matches.
