## Overview

The `consumers.py` file defines a **consumer** class, which is a core component of Django Channels. This class (`NotificationConsumer`) handles WebSocket connections, allowing for real-time data transfer between the server and client. It is typically used for features like notifications, live chat, and more.

## Imports

```python
from channels.consumer import SyncConsumer
from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync
from channels.layers import get_channel_layer
import json
import logging
```

- **SyncConsumer**: A synchronous consumer that handles WebSocket connections. It's part of the Django Channels library.
- **async_to_sync**: A utility to convert asynchronous code to synchronous code.
- **get_channel_layer**: Retrieves the default channel layer for sending/receiving messages.
- **json**: A module for handling JSON data.
- **logging**: A module to incorporate logging into the application. Here, it's used to log WebSocket events.

## NotificationConsumer Class

```python
class NotificationConsumer(SyncConsumer):
```

The **`NotificationConsumer`** class inherits from `SyncConsumer`, indicating that it processes WebSocket events synchronously. Within this class, several methods handle different stages of a WebSocket connection.

## Methods

### websocket_connect

```python
def websocket_connect(self, event):
    self.room_name = self.scope['url_route']['kwargs']['room_name']
    self.room_group_name = 'user_%s' % self.room_name
    async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_add)(
        self.room_group_name,
        self.channel_name
    )
    self.send({
        "type": "websocket.accept",
    })
```

- **Purpose**: Handles a new WebSocket connection.
- **Functionality**:
  - Extracts the `room_name` from the URL route.
  - Constructs a `room_group_name` for the user.
  - Adds the WebSocket channel to the specified group using `group_add`.
  - Sends a response to accept the WebSocket connection.

### send_notification

```python
def send_notification(self, event):
    """ Called when someone has messaged our chat. """
    logger.info(f'data recvieve >> {event["data"]}')
    self.send({
        'type': 'websocket.send',
        "text": event["data"],
    })
```

- **Purpose**: Sends a notification/message over the WebSocket.
- **Functionality**:
  - Logs the received data using `logger`.
  - Sends the message data to the WebSocket client.

### websocket_receive

```python
def websocket_receive(self, event):
    # add missing implementation
    pass
```

- **Purpose**: Intended to handle incoming WebSocket messages.
- **Functionality**: Currently, the implementation is missing and needs to be added for full functionality.

### websocket_disconnect

```python
def websocket_disconnect(self, event):
    print("socket disconnected")
    async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_discard)(
        self.room_group_name,
        self.channel_name
    )
    print(event)
```

- **Purpose**: Manages the disconnection of a WebSocket.
- **Functionality**:
  - Prints a message indicating the WebSocket is disconnected.
  - Removes the channel from the group using `group_discard`.

### Conclusion

The `consumers.py` file is a crucial component for enabling real-time functionalities via WebSockets in a Django Channels application. With methods to connect, receive, and disconnect WebSockets, it forms the backbone for interactive and dynamic web applications. Developers can extend and integrate this code to suit various real-time communication needs.
