# Documentation for `discord_removal.py`

## Overview
The `discord_removal.py` script is a Django management command that is designed to clear the Discord usernames and related information from the profiles of all users in the database. This script is particularly useful when there is a need to reset or remove Discord-related data from user profiles across the entire application.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this management command is to automate the process of clearing Discord-related fields in the `Profile` model. This can be useful in scenarios such as data cleanup, privacy concerns, or preparation for a new integration with Discord.

## Usage
To execute this command, navigate to the Django project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py discord_removal
```

This command will clear the Discord information for all user profiles and print a confirmation message upon completion.

## Code Breakdown
Here is a breakdown of the code in `discord_removal.py`:

```python
from accounts.models import Profile
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Clear player discord username in the profile command'

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        Profile.objects.update(discord_id='', discord_uid='', discord_json=None)
        self.stdout.write('Cleared all player discord username in entire database.')
```

### Components
- **Imports**:
  - `Profile`: This is the model from which the Discord data will be cleared.
  - `BaseCommand`: This is the base class for creating custom Django management commands.

- **Command Class**:
  - `help`: A string attribute that provides a brief description of what the command does.
  - `handle(self, *args, **kwargs)`: This method contains the logic that will be executed when the command is run. It updates the `discord_id`, `discord_uid`, and `discord_json` fields to empty values for all entries in the `Profile` model.

- **Output**:
  - After the execution of the command, it prints a message indicating that all player Discord usernames have been cleared from the database.

## Considerations
- **Data Loss**: Running this command will permanently remove Discord information from all profiles. Ensure that this action is intended and that any necessary data backups are made prior to execution.
  
- **Database Impact**: This command will perform an update on all profile entries in the database, which can be resource-intensive depending on the size of the user base. It is recommended to run this during off-peak hours to minimize performance impact.

This command is a simple yet powerful tool for managing user profile data related to Discord integrations within a Django application.
