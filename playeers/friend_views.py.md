# Friend Views Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `friend_views.py` file, which is responsible for handling various friend-related operations in a Django application. The operations include listing friends, creating new friend requests, managing notifications, handling favorites, and managing friend requests. This file utilizes Django Rest Framework's generic views and custom serializers to achieve these functionalities.

## üìÑ Overview

The primary components in this file are:

- **API Views**: These handle HTTP requests and define the logic for various friend-related operations.
- **Serializers**: Used to convert complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, into native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
