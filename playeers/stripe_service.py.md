## Classes

### StripeService
The `StripeService` class is a static utility class that provides methods to interact with the Stripe-related models in the application. It does not require instantiation and all its methods are static.

## Methods

### get_stripe_account
```python
@staticmethod
def get_stripe_account(player):
    stripe_account = StripeAccount.objects.filter(player=player).first()
    return stripe_account
```
- **Description**: Retrieves the Stripe account associated with a given player. This method queries the `StripeAccount` model using the player as a filter criterion.
- **Parameters**:
  - `player`: The player object for which the Stripe account is to be retrieved.
- **Returns**: The first `StripeAccount` object associated with the player, or `None` if no account is found.

### create_stripe_transfer
```python
@staticmethod
def create_stripe_transfer(transfer_id, player, tansfer_type=StripeTransfer.Type.REDEEM):
    return StripeTransfer.objects.create(
        transfer=transfer_id,
        player=player,
        tansfer_type=tansfer_type
    )
```

## Summary
The `stripe_service.py` module is a crucial part of the backend service responsible for managing Stripe accounts and transactions for players. By abstracting these operations into a service class, the module promotes code reusability and maintainability, ensuring that Stripe operations are handled consistently across the application.
