# Documentation for `transaction_service.py`

This module provides a service layer for creating and managing transaction details within the application. It abstracts the creation of transaction records, making it easier to handle financial transactions within the system.

## Overview

**Module Name:** `transaction_service.py`

**Purpose:** To provide static methods for creating transaction records in the database, ensuring a consistent and centralized approach to transaction management.

## Class and Methods

### Class: `TransactionService`

The `TransactionService` class contains static methods that facilitate the creation and management of transaction records. This class does not need to be instantiated, as all methods can be accessed directly via the class.

#### Method: `create`

```python
@staticmethod
def create(
    payee, 
    receiver, 
    amount, 
    current_wallet_balance, 
    type, 
    status, 
    status_desc=None, 
    payment_method=None, 
    transaction_fee=0, 
    transaction_mode=TransactionDetail.Mode.REAL, 
    transaction_number=None
):
```

**Description:** This method is used to create a new transaction record in the `TransactionDetail` model. It takes various parameters to define the transaction details.

- **Parameters:**
  - `payee`: The user who is paying or sending the amount.
  - `receiver`: The user who is receiving the amount.
  - `amount`: The transaction amount.
  - `current_wallet_balance`: The current balance in the payee's wallet after the transaction.
  - `type`: The type of transaction (e.g., payment, refund).
  - `status`: The status of the transaction (e.g., success, failed).
  - `status_desc` (optional): A description of the transaction status.
  - `payment_method` (optional): The method used for the payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
  - `transaction_fee` (default is `0`): The fee charged for the transaction.
  - `transaction_mode` (default is `TransactionDetail.Mode.REAL`): The mode of the transaction, indicating whether it is a real transaction or a bonus.
  - `transaction_number` (optional): A unique identifier for the transaction.

- **Returns:** This method does not return a value but creates a transaction record in the database.

**Example Usage:**

```python
TransactionService.create(
    payee=user1,
    receiver=user2,
    amount=100.00,
    current_wallet_balance=900.00,
    type=TransactionDetail.Type.PAY_ENTRY_FEE,
    status=TransactionDetail.Status.SUCCESS,
    payment_method=TransactionDetail.PaymentMethod.CREDIT_CARD,
    transaction_fee=2.50
)
```

## Conclusion

The `transaction_service.py` module is crucial for handling financial transactions within the application. By using a static class method approach, it ensures a consistent and reliable way to create transaction records, which is essential for maintaining accurate financial records and user account balances.
